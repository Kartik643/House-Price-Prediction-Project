House Price Prediction Project
This project aims to predict house prices using a combination of machine learning models and various feature engineering techniques. The dataset used in this project is the famous Kaggle "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset.

Project Structure
1. Data Loading and Exploration
Import necessary libraries.
Load the training dataset using Pandas.
Perform initial data exploration with head() and visualize the distribution of the target variable SalePrice.
2. Data Visualization
Use Seaborn to create box plots of SalePrice against categorical features like Street, MSZoning, and others.
Plot the distribution of SalePrice.
Visualize the relationship between YearBuilt and SalePrice using a scatter plot.
3. Outlier Removal
Identify and remove outliers in the SalePrice column to improve model performance.
4. Handling Missing Values and Encoding Categorical Features
Identify missing values in categorical features.
Apply OneHotEncoder to transform categorical variables into a suitable format for machine learning models.
5. Data Preparation
Concatenate the numeric features and the encoded categorical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
6. Model Training and Evaluation
Train an XGBoost regressor with the training data.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
7. Stacking Regressor
Implement a stacking regressor with ElasticNet, LinearSVR, and CatBoost as base models.
Evaluate the performance of the stacked model.
8. Feature Importance
Analyze and visualize feature importances from the trained XGBoost model.
9. Test Data Prediction
Load the test data.
Apply the same preprocessing steps to the test data.
Predict house prices using the trained stacking regressor.
Prepare the submission file in the required format.
Files
train.csv: The training dataset.
test.csv: The test dataset.
sample_submission.csv: Sample submission file to guide the format of the submission.
HousePricePrediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow from data loading to model training and evaluation.
submission.csv: The final submission file with predicted house prices.
Usage
Clone the repository.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
Ensure you have all required libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost catboost
Run the Jupyter notebook HousePricePrediction.ipynb to execute the workflow.

Generate the final submission file and upload it to Kaggle.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow for house price prediction, from data preprocessing and visualization to model training and evaluation. By using advanced techniques like stacking regressor, it aims to achieve better predictive performance.
